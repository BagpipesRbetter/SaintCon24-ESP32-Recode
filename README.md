## This *MY* attempt at a recode of the SaintCon24 Badge
from what i can tell the badge is assembled from a
```
- esp32-s3(not sure how the other components are wired,
- tft screen(h28008?),
- li-batt,
- ir recever and sender(prob wont use),
- on off switch(disconnects batt and the usb{power} from SOC)
